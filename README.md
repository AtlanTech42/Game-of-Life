# Game-of-Life
This is Conway's Game of Life simulator, building it just to practice more complicated simulations and so i'm not following any guides, just using these 4 rules: 
Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.
Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
